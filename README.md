pet profiling system and health checking service

The forth project for Objected-Oriented Programming (Java) was making a
service that asks a user number of dog owners, their names, and their dog's 
name. Both the number of owners and dogs could be one or two. It then randomly
generates weight, sex, hunger, money for the owner since we are only making 
this as a project. Similarly, it randomly generates weight, sex, hunger, fun, 
cleanliness, and loyalty of each of the dogs. Thus this service is like a game
in essence since the user wants to keep changing all the elements as long as he 
or she wants. In this project, there are four classes, Main, Mammal, Human, and
Dog. Both Human and Dog classes extend to Mammal class. Thus the code for Mammal
class is much shorter than the other two classes. Main class prompts the user for
all the information needed to generate the information and displays a menu. 

One of the difficulties I found in the project is figuring about which 
attributes and methods to be "sub".

What I can do to improve this project is displaying the information about
the second human and his or her dogs at the same time with the first human 
without the user making any choice out of the menu.
